Similarly, I don't think it's obvious you would need to press 'reset' to get older news when on someone's profile. This is especially the case for Paula Vennells who has a blank profile due to no current articles. Maybe a separate 'view older articles'/'later dates' would be better.","Yes","No","It is very relevant to the news today. More and more emphasis is put on how bias news outlets/articles are, and people can make an informed choice of what they read. ","I think a general summary (ie, in form of a pie chart or graph) of how someone's representation in media has changed over time would be effective. Especially, for example, if 'negative breaking news' *Prince Andrew Paula Vennells* had just occurred, you'd be able to see the rise of unfavourable articles over time.","Publisher's specific representations of person(s)","Under 25","Yes","Yes","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Yes","5","The app forces people to be exposed to media they can shelter themselves from, and can stops people living in 'echo chambers'.

Updating the about page to either include more details on how sentiment analysis works or a link to a page describing the methods used.
