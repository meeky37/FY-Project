It was also the artist\u2019s first time taking on the challenge of making a dragon closely related to Chinese mythology.\u201cIt took him five months to painstakingly weave the dragon before shipping it to the temple for finishing touches, and eventually hoisting it up,\u201d he said.The village, which includes a 8.9ha bamboo valley, an old folks home and a cafe, is also in the midst of transforming the temple in tandem with the bamboo concept.The renovation is expected to be completed by the middle of the year.\u201cThis is in line with the bamboo theme that runs through the village. Our bamboo valley is also decorated with various elements for visitors to enjoy and take photos with, making it a tourist attraction for people from various walks of life,\u201d said Lim.During the festive season, the village is open daily from 9am until 6pm. However, it will be open until 10pm this Saturday and Sunday.",

It was also the artist\u2019s first time taking on the challenge of making a dragon closely related to Chinese mythology.\u201cIt took him five months to painstakingly weave the dragon before shipping it to the temple for finishing touches, and eventually hoisting it up,\u201d he said.The village, which includes a 8.9ha bamboo valley, an old folks home and a cafe, is also in the midst of transforming the temple in tandem with the bamboo concept.The renovation is expected to be completed by the middle of the year.\u201cThis is in line with the bamboo theme that runs through the village. Our bamboo valley is also decorated with various elements for visitors to enjoy and take photos with, making it a tourist attraction for people from various walks of life,\u201d said Lim.During the festive season, the village is open daily from 9am until 6pm. However, it will be open until 10pm this Saturday and Sunday.",

It was also the artist\u2019s first time taking on the challenge of making a dragon closely related to Chinese mythology.\u201cIt took him five months to painstakingly weave the dragon before shipping it to the temple for finishing touches, and eventually hoisting it up,\u201d he said.The village, which includes a 8.9ha bamboo valley, an old folks home and a cafe, is also in the midst of transforming the temple in tandem with the bamboo concept.The renovation is expected to be completed by the middle of the year.\u201cThis is in line with the bamboo theme that runs through the village. Our bamboo valley is also decorated with various elements for visitors to enjoy and take photos with, making it a tourist attraction for people from various walks of life,\u201d said Lim.During the festive season, the village is open daily from 9am until 6pm. However, it will be open until 10pm this Saturday and Sunday.",
