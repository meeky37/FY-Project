"""
Module: article_processor.py

Designed to process and analyse articles, extracting key entities (classed as PERSON),
identifying the positions of all their mentions, including coreferences, with efforts
to work towards a single FIRST LAST name for each person mentioned in the text. 
Those consolidated entity/coref clusters that meet the threshold can then be processed
by the SentimentAnalyser class (see sentiment_resolver.py) and its methods.

Key Features:
- Entity Recognition: Identifies named entities in the text.
- Coreference Resolution: Resolves references to the same entity across the article, 
grouping mentions.
- Entity-to-Cluster Mapping: Maps identified entities to their respective coreference 
clusters both intra and inter cluster consolidation is attempted.
- Data Cleaning and Normalisation: Cleans and normalises entity names by removing 
unnecessary characters, standardising formats, and correcting capitalisation.
- Filtering: Filters entities based on mention thresholds and name length to ensure 
relevance and accuracy.
- Database Interaction: Saves articles and their processed metadata, including 
linguistic statistics and entity information, to a database for persistence and further analysis.

        1. Substring Matching: If one entity is a substring of another entity, they
        are considered as candidates for consolidation. For example, if "Rishi" is a
        substring of "Rishi Sunak," the code merges them into the longer version, "Rishi Sunak."

        2. First and Second Name Combination: If there are two entities, one
        representing the first name and the other representing the last name, and
        they share the same coreference cluster, the code attempts to combine them
        into a single entity.

        3. 9th November - add while loop to see if continuing consolidation until no more
        consolidation takes place results in a better consolidation as theorised.

        4. 16th November - resolve instances of 'King\n11:43' which should be King.

        The consolidation process involves:
            1. Intra-cluster Consolidation:
            - Entities within the same cluster are examined for substring relationships between their names.
            - Entities are either merged by removing the entity with the shorter name or by creating a new 
                entity entry if a combined entity name is relevant within the cluster context.
            - Special indicators mark entries that have been merged or combined, 
                facilitating subsequent processing steps.

            2. Inter-cluster Consolidation:
            - After refining entities within clusters, the process checks across different clusters for 
                potential entity merges based on name substring relationships.
            - Clusters with related entities are merged by updating cluster IDs to a combined format and 
                consolidating cluster texts and positions, aiming to create a more coherent representation 
                of related entities across the dataset.
            
            3. Finishing touches:
            - Entity names are cleaned and standardised, removing unrequired characters and ensuring proper
              formatting e.g quote marks.
            - Entities failing to meet the 20% mention threshold or exceeding a three-word limit are
              filtered out.
            - The refined list of entities is further cleaned to address any remaining inconsistencies,
              like overlapping substrings.
