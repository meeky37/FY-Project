      "text/plain": "'Hackable Halloween games MMXXIII\\n13 spooktacular games plus source code for readers to jam on.\\nWe’re spending Women’s History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Read more about Erin Spiceland: Software Engineer at SpaceX.\\nEvery March we recognize the women who have shaped history—and now, we’re taking a look forward. From driving software development in large companies to maintaining thriving open source communities, we’re spending Women’s History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Erin Spiceland is a Software Engineer for SpaceX. Born and raised in rural south Georgia, she is a Choctaw and Chickasaw mother of two now living in downtown Los Angeles. Erin didn’t finish college—she’s a predominantly self-taught software engineer. In her spare time, she makes handmade Native American beadwork and regalia and attends powwows.\\nMy career has been a winding road through periods of stimulation and health as well as periods of personal misery. During it all, I’ve learned a variety of programming languages and technologies while working on a diverse array of products and services. I’m a domestic abuse survivor and a Choctaw bisexual polyamorous woman. I’m so proud of myself that I made it this far considering where I came from.\\nIn 2007, I had a three-year-old daughter and I was trying to finish my computer science degree one class at a time, all while keeping my house and family running smoothly. I found the math classes exciting and quickly finished my math minor, leaving only computer science classes. I was looking at about five years before I would graduate. Then, my husband at the time recommended me for an entry software developer position at a telecom and digital communications company.\\nWhen faced with the choice between an expensive computer science degree and getting paid to do what I loved, I dropped out of college and accepted the job. I was hired to work on internal tooling, and eventually, products. I did a lot of development on product front-ends, embedded network devices, and a distributed platform-as-a-service. I learned Java/JSP, Python, JavaScript/CSS, Node.js, as well as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and distributed systems architecture. It was an intense experience that required a lot of self-teaching, asking others for help, and daycare, but it set me up for my later successes.\\nI appreciate and admire technical, effective leaders who care for their reports as humans, not as lines on a burndown chart, and forego heavy-handed direction in favor of communication and mutual dialogue. I think it’s as important for a leader to concern herself with her coworkers’ personal well-being as it is for her to direct their performance.\\nLast year I took a pay cut to move from a safe, easy job where I had security to work in a language I hadn’t seen in years and with systems more complicated than anything I’d worked with before. I moved from a place where I had a huge four bedroom house to a studio apartment that was twice the price. I moved away from my children, of who I share custody with my ex-husband. We fly across the U.S. to see each other now. I miss my children every day. However, I get to be a wonderful role model for them.\\nI can’t wait to wake up every day with my partner who loves me so much. I’m looking forward to showing my children exactly how far they can go. I’m excited to keep exploring Los Angeles.\\nWant to know more about Erin Spiceland? Follow them on GitHub or Twitter.\\nWant to learn more about featured leaders for Women’s History Month? Read about:\\nCheck back in soon—we’ll be adding new interviews weekly throughout March.'"

      "text/plain": "\"FRANK FIELD: I battled Labour's bullying, deceitful hard-Left all my political career – until the day Momentum thugs forced me out of the party I'd devoted 60 years of my life to\\nMy father loathed me. I was conscious of this from my earliest days. In his eyes, I was a particularly difficult child. This was the basis of his persistent bullying of me, in which I never knew when I would be subjected to the next onslaught.\\nHis behaviour taught me much about the tyranny of arbitrary power, but also about how power could be lost. I was 15 when he came at me with a hammer. I took it from him and told him if he did it again, I would use it on him.\\nThe balance of power had changed. Before I acted, I'd had no idea I would prove to be the stronger, but I was. No more physical bullying.\\nThis experience stood me in good stead to oppose the bullying by the hard Left — the Trotskyist tendencies that took over the Birkenhead Labour Party, where I was MP in the early 1980s, and the bullying by Jeremy Corbyn's Momentum group decades later.\\nFor significant parts of my political life, the Labour Party was unelectable in Westminster. A main reason was the influence of Trotskyism and the hard Left. My activities against the Trotskyites became part of Labour's battle to regain the trust of the electorate.\\nUndermined: Former Labour MP Frank Field with ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in 2016\\nMy trials began in 1979 when I was elected as Labour MP for Birkenhead, the old shipbuilding town across the Mersey from Liverpool.\\nI was 37 and practically the whole of the local party was older than me, having grown old in the struggle for the New Jerusalem. They tried to live out a set of political ideas from which they expected to gain no personal honour.\\nBut there was a cuckoo in the nest, a lying, cheating, bullying cuckoo. The votes had barely been counted when I was warned by far-Left pressure group Militant that, if I didn't take their line, I'd be deselected before the next election.\\nWhat was the point of being an MP if I could only serve Birkenhead on their terms, rather than trying to interpret for myself what I believed to be best for my constituents?\\nA huge power struggle erupted once it became clear that I was not prepared to accept their diktat.\\nParty meetings became chaotic. Militant member after Militant member got up to tell shocking lies about me. Every new lie left me aghast. What sort of machine did they have to think up such a campaign?\\nI would regularly wake up at night, my heart thumping, as the next meeting approached. One morning, I was shaving when I found myself thinking about facing the Trots at our next meeting. Such was my fear that I vomited.\\nI looked into the mirror at my pathetic face, with sick all over my shaving cream. I said to myself that I could think of any number of excuses that would appear plausible for not appearing at that night's meeting. But if I so acted, I would be running away from such conflicts for the rest of my life. To the meeting I went.\\nMy battles with the hard Left continued throughout my years as a Labour MP, right up to the day I was ejected from the party to which I'd been devoted my entire adult life.\\nThe whole affair started oddly with me actually nominating the hard Left's Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the leadership contest to succeed Ed Miliband back in 2015. I would never have done so had I thought for a second that he would win, and this judgment was shared by those on the hard Left who reckoned their chances of success were nil.\\nBut I do believe that what the hard Left define as their socialist views have a place in the Labour Party.\\nI also firmly believe it is crucial for different sectors of the party to be able to contribute to its local and national debate, since that is where the nuance of democracy needs to be practised.\\nFrank Field outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster\\nI wished the Corbynite views to play a part in the leadership contest — to help influence the outcome but not to dominate it. Sadly, once Corbyn was in power, the hard Left's total domination of the debate was served up as a form of party democracy.\\nI knew Jeremy. He had served on the Health and Social Services committee I chaired during the 1992-97 Parliament, but he had never actually spoken to me.\\nHe now came up to thank me for nominating him — talking to me for the first time ever, including all the committee sessions.\\nI was so surprised at being spoken to that my answer simply jumped out: 'I won't be voting for you.'\\n'I never expected you would,' came the equally quick reply.\\nThe election of party leader was on a 'one person, one vote' basis, something I had campaigned for. In adopting this reform, it was assumed the age-old rules aimed at protecting the Labour Party from extremist infiltration would continue to operate.\\nBut under Ed Miliband's leadership, the party made a fatal error that resulted in Corbyn being elected.\\nMiliband introduced a very cheap party membership which gave new members the right to help elect the next leader. Anyone could join, and some Tories openly did to vote for Corbyn, as this would be of most advantage to them.\\nBut so, too, did huge numbers of people with Trotskyite sympathies. The hard Left saw the unique opportunity this party reform offered them and acted ruthlessly.\\nLabour under Ed Miliband lowered the party's protective shield against those groups which historically had tried to destroy the Labour Party. Many of them piled into the Labour Party to vote for Corbyn — and he won.\\nThey soon came for me. In Birkenhead, a leading Momentum supporter accused me of attempting to undermine the National Minimum Wage policy — a typical untruth peddled in order to undermine the credibility of an elected Labour MP who would not bend to their agenda.\\nAt a local Labour Party meeting, I explained the history — I'd actually established the Low Pay Unit back in 1974 and we'd lobbied to gain a legally backed wage for all workers.\\nWalter Smith, our local party chair, son of a trade union leader and Labour to his core, came to my support, but later allegations were made to the police that he had physically assaulted a fellow Labour councillor at that meeting. He was questioned under caution.\\nThe caution had the most dramatic impact on him. He felt ashamed and two weeks later died of a massive heart attack, aged 82. Walter Smith was kind and full of goodness, never holding a grudge against anyone, as far as I could judge. In some instances, I thought he was too tolerant of the intolerance around us.\\nThe idea that this man could suffer a heart attack after a lifetime of service, without the National Labour Party lifting a finger to inquire as to the circumstances surrounding his death, appalled me.\\nA characteristic of totalitarianism has always been a complete disregard for individual life. A pattern of events was beginning to emerge that showed how the Corbyn Labour Party would behave if it ever formed a government.\\nAt a party, I complained to friends and supporters about the bullying behaviour to which party members were increasingly being subjected.\\nEvery attempt to restore civilised values had been knocked back by Labour Party bureaucracy, generally by ignoring each complaint and submission.\\nI pledged to resign the party whip if I failed to get the National Labour Party to adjudicate in what I saw as trumped-up charges against Walter.\\nTime and time again I requested specific action about Walter's case. None was forthcoming, not even a formal reply to any of my requests. Even when the Chief Whip sought action, nothing happened.\\nI was brought up sharp by the deep calamity and wretchedness the Labour Party had fallen into, with Corbyn cultivating a tolerance of the thuggery we were experiencing from Momentum activists.\\nIt had a familiar ring. I'd tried to forget the horror of Militant activists back in the early 1980s, but now those memories were snatched out of that far recess of my mind and replayed, this time with a Militant and Momentum line-up.\\nMomentum had joined forces with those from Militant who were still knocking around and had been welcomed back into the party by the leadership. Those malevolent events of lying, cheating, bullying and the like, which were the stuff of Militant politics, were now centre-stage and appealing to a wider membership that carried this hateful DNA.\\nThe National Labour Party was also harbouring anti-Semites. All too many of Jeremy Corbyn's past associations were with groupings who believed it was legitimate to use violence to achieve their political ends, including those committed to wiping Israel off the face of the map.\\nFor both these reasons, I resigned the Labour whip on August 30, 2018.\\nI did so because of the active protection of thugs by Corbyn's National Executive Committee (NEC), which had resulted in bullying behaviour becoming the norm against anyone deemed to be unsound on Corbyn, and because his Labour Party bent over backwards to harbour anti-Semites to such a degree that anti-Semitism had become part of Labour's DNA.\\nI saw the chief whip Nick Brown in his office, where he told me I had two weeks to reconsider and withdraw my resignation. If I didn't, I would cease to be a member of the Labour Party.\\nI gasped. I never thought for one moment I would lose my party membership. I never viewed resigning the whip as a capital offence. I had assured my friends that, should I fail to get an inquiry for Walter, I would nonetheless remain a Labour Party member, as I had been for very nearly six decades.\\nBrown showed me the Labour's rule book, which decreed that 'All Labour MPs shall be members of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and play their part in its work.'\\n'This doesn't apply to me, Nick,' I responded. I still saw myself as a Labour MP in every aspect of my work, while I continued to fight for justice against the thuggery in the Birkenhead Labour Party.\\n'I shall legally contest this ruling's applicability to me,' I kept muttering.\\nBut it did. A letter of execution headed with my Labour Party membership number of 60 years told me I was out of the party. It added that, now I was no longer a member, my complaints about the thuggish behaviour by Momentum members were no longer being considered.\\nLabour under Ed Miliband (pictured) lowered the party's protective shield against those groups which historically had tried to destroy the Labour Party\\nI stress this action as it suggests Labour Party bureaucrats believe either they are above the law or that no law applies to them. The Labour Party is a corporate body, and anyone, member or not, has a right to complain about its conduct.\\nBut for all my protests, that was me gone. In a two-line statement Corbyn thanked me for 60 years' membership — as though I had resigned from the local whist club for showing intermittent commitment during a probationary year's membership.\\nAt the next general election, I stood in Birkenhead as the Social Justice candidate but, despite a small bank of loyal supporters, I lost. The hard Left had bussed in people to work their campaign. One evening I went into a local pub and found a note from a group that was just leaving. It said: 'Up from Wokingham to get you.'\\nAnd so they did. My 7,000 votes were overwhelmed by the total for the official Labour candidate. I was out and Momentum and the hard Left were in.\\nWhy did I make all this fuss about my membership of the Labour Party once I had resigned from the party whip? Why did I involve myself in protracted warfare with Corbyn and his bureaucracy to overturn their arbitrary decision to expel me?\\nBecause from the day I joined, it wasn't the Labour Party organisation to which I was giving my loyalty. It was with the party's ideas, vision and direction of political travel that I wished to join forces. I still do.\\nFreedom from the exercise of arbitrary power has been both the simplest and strongest of all my drives. You could say I learned it at my father's knee that day he came at me with a hammer.\\n- Adapted from Politics, Poverty And Belief: A Political Memoir by The Rt Hon Frank Field (Bloomsbury, £20). © Frank Field 2023.
