      "text/plain": "\"Release Radar · Hacktoberfest 2023 Edition\\nAs Hacktoberfest comes to a close, you still have a day or so left to complete and submit your pull requests. If you're struggling to think of projects to contribute…\\nWe’re spending Women’s History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Read more about Erin Spiceland: Software Engineer at SpaceX.\\nEvery March we recognize the women who have shaped history—and now, we’re taking a look forward. From driving software development in large companies to maintaining thriving open source communities, we’re spending Women’s History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Erin Spiceland is a Software Engineer for SpaceX. Born and raised in rural south Georgia, she is a Choctaw and Chickasaw mother of two now living in downtown Los Angeles. Erin didn’t finish college—she’s a predominantly self-taught software engineer. In her spare time, she makes handmade Native American beadwork and regalia and attends powwows.\\nMy career has been a winding road through periods of stimulation and health as well as periods of personal misery. During it all, I’ve learned a variety of programming languages and technologies while working on a diverse array of products and services. I’m a domestic abuse survivor and a Choctaw bisexual polyamorous woman. I’m so proud of myself that I made it this far considering where I came from.\\nIn 2007, I had a three-year-old daughter and I was trying to finish my computer science degree one class at a time, all while keeping my house and family running smoothly. I found the math classes exciting and quickly finished my math minor, leaving only computer science classes. I was looking at about five years before I would graduate. Then, my husband at the time recommended me for an entry software developer position at a telecom and digital communications company.\\nWhen faced with the choice between an expensive computer science degree and getting paid to do what I loved, I dropped out of college and accepted the job. I was hired to work on internal tooling, and eventually, products. I did a lot of development on product front-ends, embedded network devices, and a distributed platform-as-a-service. I learned Java/JSP, Python, JavaScript/CSS, Node.js, as well as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and distributed systems architecture. It was an intense experience that required a lot of self-teaching, asking others for help, and daycare, but it set me up for my later successes.\\nI appreciate and admire technical, effective leaders who care for their reports as humans, not as lines on a burndown chart, and forego heavy-handed direction in favor of communication and mutual dialogue. I think it’s as important for a leader to concern herself with her coworkers’ personal well-being as it is for her to direct their performance.\\nLast year I took a pay cut to move from a safe, easy job where I had security to work in a language I hadn’t seen in years and with systems more complicated than anything I’d worked with before. I moved from a place where I had a huge four bedroom house to a studio apartment that was twice the price. I moved away from my children, of who I share custody with my ex-husband. We fly across the U.S. to see each other now. I miss my children every day. However, I get to be a wonderful role model for them.\\nI can’t wait to wake up every day with my partner who loves me so much. I’m looking forward to showing my children exactly how far they can go. I’m excited to keep exploring Los Angeles.\\nWant to know more about Erin Spiceland? Follow them on GitHub or Twitter.\\nWant to learn more about featured leaders for Women’s History Month? Read about:\\nCheck back in soon—we’ll be adding new interviews weekly throughout March.\""

However, Henry VI did come out of his stupor and it is not yet impossible for the Tories to do the same\\nHowever, as yet, the actions do not follow the words.\\nRishi Sunak's speech on reducing the impact of net zero regulation was a start.\\nBut the penal Energy Bill is just days from Royal Assent.\\nAmong other terrors, it makes provision for sending people to prison who make mistakes on their home insulation\\nIt is simply no good to oppose more regulation in the spoken word while introducing it in the black letter of legislation.\\nWords and actions must meet and as the words are popular, they need to be followed up with action.\\nWe also need to stop attacking Tory voters.\\nOn Monday, we'll see the landlord-bashing Renters Reform Bill in the Commons.\\nIt is unpopular with Tory MPs and the Whips' Office apparently advised against it.\\nBut Downing Street insists on ploughing ahead with a Bill that will hurt renters as well as landlords in a socialist belief in regulating free contracts to stop landlords and tenants agreeing mutually beneficial arrangements.\\nIt should be dropped.\\nMoreover, whichever clever clogs in Number 10 thought announcing a ban on conversion therapy on the morning of a by-election needs to be found a comfortable place in a rest home.\\nIt is a policy that accepts the most extreme version of the gender change fanatics, bans abuse that is already illegal and is at the apex of woke ideology.\\nIt is in no way conservative and I expect any Conservative who read about it on Thursday morning in Tamworth or Mid-Bedfordshire left their umbrellas firmly furled and their front door firmly closed.\\nTaxation is another area where there is no incentive for Conservatives to go out to vote.\\nEven Sir Keir Starmer says that the burden is too high, while the Government is in thrall to the OBR and the Bank of England, whose error-strewn record is only too apparent.\\nThe State spends and taxes too much, and both need to be reduced.\\nNothing is being done to inspire voters to turn out, and to assume that they will next year to stop Sir Keir Starmer is wishful thinking\\nThe recently-announced decision to trim the Civil Service is simply not ambitious enough.\\nIt is only two-thirds of the plan that was ready to be put into action a year ago.\\nMore decisions to cut back on folly, as with the welcome cancellation of HS2, need to be made, and Tory Ministers need to stop defining their success by how much they spend.\\nWhen a Minister says we have increased government spending on this or that worthy cause, what he really means is: I have placed an extra burden on taxpayers.\\nInstead, the money needs to be found to help families and businesses.\\nThe Corporation Tax rise should be reversed, death duties scrapped and fiscal drag - that is putting millions of people's income tax rate up from 20 per cent to 40 per cent on the same real income, needs to be tackled.\\nTo boost the economy further, the Government must use the Brexit freedoms that it has been so timid about thus far.\\nInstead of scrapping EU regulations, the Government decided to keep them, worried that it might accidentally abolish unnecessary red tape.\\nHowever, this has meant it has kept hundreds of unnecessary regulations that British governments opposed when they were introduced, and has so far only repealed fairly unimportant items.\\nIt needs to act swiftly to remove any regulations that damage the consumer interest, such as the ban on parallel imports, or the REACH regulations, which simply act as a barrier to innovation and competition in the chemical industry.\\nDeregulation lowers costs, helps reduce inflation and makes everyone better off.\\nThe Government also needs to be clear on immigration.\\nSmall boats are a problem which needs to be tackled.\\nBut it is by no means not the whole problem.\\nNet migration of 606,000 in 2022 is simply too much.\\nPost-Brexit, it is under the control of the Government to reduce this scale of net migration as the rules are made by secondary legislation.\\nYet once again, the malign hand of the Treasury and the OBR is behind the excessive influx as they focus on GDP, not GDP per capita.\\nBut it is not just an economic issue.\\nIt is also about integration and infrastructure.\\nHow can society cope?\\nRishi Sunak's speech on reducing the impact of net zero regulation was a start. But words need to be followed by action\\nIn a way, the focus on small boats has been a distraction from the real problem.\\nBut it has not distracted the communities affected by this scale of inward migration.\\nAbove all, the Prime Minister needs to concentrate on the big issues and forget the trivial.\\nNo-one is excited about maths to 18 or changes to A levels in 20 years' time, or indeed a smoking ban set for an arbitrary date that means Peter and Mary can buy cigarettes for Thomas, Anselm, Alfred and Sixtus for the rest of their lives.\\nA ban that encourages a domestic black market for the Rees-Mogg family is nugatory.\\nIt is high time to stop hitting our own voters with policies that make them worse off or with woke nonsense that offends them.\\nInstead, we need to start cutting the size of the State, tax cuts that give people back their own money and a solution to the migration issue.\\nPerhaps like Henry the Sixth, the Conservative Party and government will suddenly wake up.\\nIf we don't, last week's by-election results will be simply an early taste of the bitter outcome of next year's General Election.\\n- Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg is Tory MP for North-East Somerset\\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\""

      "'Think twice before imposing Ulez tax on hard-working Brits': Rishi Sunak blasts Sadiq Khan for his hated low emission zone expansion plan\n",
      "- Keir Starmer told to 'get off the fence' over Sadiq Khan's Ulez by senior Tory MPs\n",
      "- Rishi Sunak led MPs asking Starmer to get London mayor to postpone the levy\n",
      "- READ MORE: Labour civil war over ULEZ intensifies after Khan's High Court win\n",
      "Keir Starmer faced fresh calls last night for him to try to delay the expansion of London's clean air zone.\n",
      "Senior Tories said he should 'get off the fence' and force the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan to protect motorists set to pay the Ulez levy.\n",
      "The High Court yesterday backed the extension of Ulez into outer London – a move that could lead to similar schemes elsewhere in Britain.\n",
      "Sir Keir has refused to say whether the zone should expand, claiming it is not a 'simple political decision'. He remained silent after yesterday's court ruling.\n",
      "Rishi Sunak last night led MPs and campaigners asking the Labour leader to make Mr Khan either postpone the £12.50 daily levy for older, more polluting vehicles or ditch it entirely. The zone expands on August 29.\n",
      "Keir Starmer (left) faced fresh calls last night for him to try to delay the expansion of London mayor Sadiq Khan's (right) Ulez\n",
      "Rishi Sunak (pictured) last night led MPs and campaigners asking the Labour leader to make Mr Khan either postpone the £12.50 daily levy for older, more polluting vehicles or ditch it\n",
      "The Prime Minister said: 'Sir Keir Starmer's mayor should think twice before choosing to press ahead with imposing this Ulez tax on hard-working people.\n",
      "READ MORE: Labour civil war over ULEZ intensifies as shadow health secretary says Starmer 'doesn't want expansion to happen' but Sadiq Khan vows to extend £12.50 daily charge from 29 August after High Court win\n",
      "It will mean ordinary people will have to pay £12.50 every time they take their kids to school, go to the doctors or to do their weekly food shop. And at a time of high inflation and cost of living that would be an incredibly unnecessary burden to inflict on hardworking families.'\n",
      "Mr Khan's plans, which will see nearly 700,000 cars across Greater London pay the daily charge, according to the RAC, have caused outrage among some families and tradesmen who rely on their vehicles.\n",
      "More than 1.5million people living outside London could also be affected by the expanded Ulez zone, data from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency revealed this year.\n",
      "Responding to yesterday's ruling, Mr Khan insisted nine out of ten cars in outer London would not need to pay the charge, adding: 'The decision to expand the Ulez was very difficult and not something I took lightly and I continue to do everything possible to address any concerns Londoners may have.\n",
      "'This unambiguous decision today in the High Court allows us to press on with the difficult but vital task of cleaning up London's air and tackling the climate crisis.'\n",
      "Senior Labour figures blamed Ulez for their failure to win last week's by-election in Uxbridge, Boris Johnson's old seat in west London. Sir Keir said last weekend: 'We are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet. We've got to face up to that and learn the lessons.'\n",
      "But on Wednesday the Labour leader dodged a question on whether the Ulez extension should proceed, saying it was up to Mr Khan to decide whether to press on with the policy.\n",
      "Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves this week said it was 'not the right time' to expand Ulez in London. The party's health spokesman, Wes Streeting, told Times Radio: 'Keir has been very clear that he doesn't want it to go ahead at this stage, as has Rachel Reeves.\n",
      "'I would agree with them. But Sadiq is the mayor of London. He doesn't answer to us, he answers to Londoners. If you believe in devolution, you believe in his right to do that. We're going to have to take it on the chin. And he's going to take the criticism on the chin and we'll see what happens.'\n",
      "Energy Secretary Grant Shapps said the issue would show what type of leader Sir Keir was: 'Time to get off the fence and tell your mayor to do the right thing and stop the Ulez expansion.'\n",
      "'Ulez premium' on used cars\n",
      "Drivers buying used cars that will avoid daily fees from the planned expansion of London's ultra-low emission zone are being hit by a 'price penalty', analysis suggests.\n",
      "Auto Trader, an online marketplace, said some motorists were being charged over £3,000 more for Ulez-compliant vehicles compared with identical models only a year older that do not meet the emissions standards.\n",
      "To avoid the £12.50 daily fee for driving in the Ulez area, diesel cars must generally have been first registered after September 2015, while most petrol cars registered after 2005 are also exempt. Auto Trader said the biggest price gap across the UK involved a used Volkswagen Golf 2016 model being sold for £13,046 – £3,601 more than a 2015 non-compliant price of £9,445.\n",
      "The company's Ian Plummer said: 'Drivers are having to pay a price penalty to follow the rules. This doesn't need to be a case of pocket over planet, it is possible to achieve both. But it's vital we get the balance right between the carrots and the sticks.'\n",
      "Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer added: 'Sir Keir needs to do the right thing, and tell the Labour mayor to ditch his Ulez expansion. It will only punish hardworking Londoners.'\n",
      "Transport Secretary Mark Harper said it 'wasn't very clear that this delivers against emissions targets at all... this is about raising money – that is what people can see and that is what they object to'.\n",
      "He added: 'The expansion of Ulez to the whole of Greater London does not make sense and we are not in favour of it.'\n",
      "The High Court challenge, which was brought by the London boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Harrow and Hillingdon along with Surrey County Council, was defeated on the grounds that Mr Khan's Ulez policy was an expansion.\n",
      "Mr Justice Swift said: 'I am satisfied that the mayor's decision to expand the Ulez area by amendment of the present road charging scheme, rather than by making an entirely new... scheme, was within his powers.' He said the consultation process gave enough information to produce informed responses.\n",
      "Responding to the ruling in a joint press release the five councils questioned whether Mr Khan had a 'moral right' to expand the scheme.\n",
      "Seven other areas have clean air zones that charge motorists in England: Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Portsmouth, Sheffield, and Newcastle and Gateshead. Labour mayor Andy Burnham is considering one in Manchester. In Scotland there is already a fully-operating low emissions zone in Glasgow, with similar schemes due to start in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen next year.\n",
      "Chris Clarkson, the Tory MP for Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, said the court ruling had serious implications for motorists across England, especially in his constituency.\n",
      "Anti-ULEZ protestors demonstrate outside The Royal Courts of Justice ahead of the ruling on the expansion of London's clean air zone\n",
      "The AA urged Mr Khan to give drivers 'more time to react' to the change or reduce the impact on them, while the RAC called on the mayor to give additional support to key workers.\n",
      "But climate charity Possible described the judgment as 'fantastic', arguing that Ulez expansion was 'sorely needed to tackle our overreliance on cars and improve air quality'.\n",
      "From Monday, access to the mayor's £110million scheme which provides grants supporting the scrapping of non Ulez-compliant vehicles in London will be extended.\n",
      "It will now include all families in receipt of child benefit and every small business.\n",
